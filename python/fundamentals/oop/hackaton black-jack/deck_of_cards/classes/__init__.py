""" The Game is going to be blackjack"""

#Rules


""" -From 2 to 9: each card has its own numerical value

- The 10s and the face cards, i.e. Jacks, Queens and Kings, are worth 10.

- The Ace is worth 1 or 11 depending on the player’s hand. If your hand does not exceed 21, the Ace counts as 11. If it does exceed 21, the Ace counts as 1. The value of the Ace is always calculated to your advantage
- The hand called ‘Blackjack’ is made up of an Ace and a card worth 10, making a total of 21, dealt in the player's first two cards.
